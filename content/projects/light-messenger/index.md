_This fun project was initiated for Saskia's farewell of TU Eindhoven. The TU/e colleagues and we wanted to prepare something special and fun for the party. So we chose Fireflies, an iconic design prototype from Saskia's PhD's research and we did some wizard workaround to create a sense of connectedness._

[⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Write. ➡️ README.md](/news/Template/)

As we might live apart with our closed friends due to some reality reasons which could be studying aboard, business travel, so on. To compensate for the missed contact with a certain relationship, we created Light Messenger, an IoT kit for a couple of friends having bi-directional communication with different colors of light. With this light kit, a user can select light different colors by rotation; send the current selected light color by a single-tap; and review the light color(s) the other sends by a double-tap.
